              Wind speed, in miles per hour. Calculated based on a 10-minute
              average, also known as the sustained wind speed. This excludes
              sudden or brief variations in wind speed, also known as wind
              gusts.

          humidity:
            description: >-
              Relative humidity of the air, defined as the ration of the amount
              of water vapour in the air to the amount of vapour required to
              bring the air to saturation at a constant temperature. Relative
              humidity is always expressed as a percentage.
